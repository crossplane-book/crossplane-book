# An Introduction to Go

We will not attempt to learn everything about Go in this book, mostly because
that is not the primary focus. We will instead cover high-level fundamentals
that allow us to knowledgeably explore Kubernetes and Crossplane. Go is renowned
for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent language for
newcomers. Understanding a few concepts can get you up and running (and writing
most of the code that we cover in this book) very quickly.
